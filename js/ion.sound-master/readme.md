## Description
* Ion.Sound â€” JavaScript-plugin for playing sounds based on Web Audio API.
* Plugin is working on most popular desktop and mobile browsers and can be used everywhere, from common web sites to browser games.
* For not so modern browsers plugin falls back to HTML5 audio.
* Audio-sprites support included.
* Ion.Sound freely distributed under terms of <a href="http://ionden.com/a/plugins/licence-en.html" target="_blank">MIT licence</a>.
* 25 free sounds included

Today websites are full of events (new mail, new chat-message, content update etc.). Often it is not enough to indicate this events only visually to get user attention. You need sounds! This library, made for playing small sounds, will help you with this task.
Also, new version of Ion.Sound is capable to handle browser games audio. It has full control of loading, playing and removing audio files. And audio-sprites support of course.

## Dependencies
* None


## Usage
Import this library:
* ion.sound.min.js

Prepare sound-files (25 sounds are included) and put them in some folder (eg. "sounds"):
* my_cool_sound.mp3
* my_cool_sound.ogg
* my_cool_sound.aac

It is not enough to have only MP3-file, you should make OGG and AAC-file too, because not all browsers support MP3.<br/>
You can easily convert you MP3-s to OGG-s and AAC-s at <a href="http://media.io/" target="_blank">Media.io</a> or at <a href="https://cloudconvert.org/formats#audio" target="_blank">CloudConvert.org</a>.<br/>
<i>AAC support was added to improve cross browser support of iOS 8.x devices (iPhone, iPad)</i>
